      <h3>A Brief History</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ada Lovelace was born Augusta Ada Byron, daughter of Lord Byron a famous (and somewhat notorious poet).</li>
        <li>Her mother, Lady Anabella Byron, fought for custody of Ada in courts to officially leave her husband - something unheard of in the early 1800s.</li>
        <li>Lord Byron died at age 36, well before Ada had a chance to know him.</li>
        <li>Due to her husband's notorious life, which including gambling, sleeping with other woman (one was potentially his half-sister), Anabella raised Ada far away in the country and unaware of the details of her father's life.</li>
        <li>Anabella was a mathematician and had her daughter tutored in math as well. Ada, without other friends or occupations, quickly excelled in this area.</li>
        <li>When Ada was finally introduced to society in London on her 18th birthday, she met the famous mathematician Charles Babbage, who had already produced a prototype for the Difference Engine, one of the first precursors to a computer, though it worked much more like an abbacus.</li>
        <li>Over the course of their friendship, Charles, influenced by conversations with Ada, developed the idea for the Analytical Enginer which would work like a Jacquard loom, using punch cards for the first computer's operations.</li>
        <li>Ada would go on to take Charle's theory and write the scientic paper on the subject, proviing that the theory could work, including tables and diagrams that produced a fully functioning program for the idea of the Analytical sadly.</li>
        <li>Sadly, due to the societal expectations of the time, Charles and Ada could be no more than close colleagues, and Ada married Lord William Lovelace.</li>
        <li>And due to Charles Babbage's increasingly bad terms with the British government at the time, the Analytical Engine would be set aside, unproduced for almost 100 years, until Alan Turing ressurected the idea during World War II, as a means to break the Nazi code.</li>
        <li>Long before that happened, Ada Lovelace died, at age 36, like her father, due to what historians believe to be ovarian cancer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Though she did not live to see her work fulfilled, Ada Lovelace's program laid the crucial ground work for what would later become the moden computer.</p>
